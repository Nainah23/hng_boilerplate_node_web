## Introduction

Welcome to the Boilerplate Project! This project provides a solid foundation for building robust APIs , the Gin framework, and Prisma for database interactions. This boilerplate aims to streamline the development process by providing a well-structured architecture, comprehensive API design, and an efficient database design.

## Architecture Overview <a name="architecture-overview"></a>

The architecture of this boilerplate project follows a modular and clean structure, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Here's a high-level overview:

#### The API design follows RESTful principles, ensuring a clear and consistent interface. Each endpoint is well-documented and adheres to best practices for API development. <a name="api-design"></a>

Endpoints: The endpoints are organized by resource and follow a standard naming convention (e.g., /api/v1/users, /api/v1/products).
HTTP Methods: Standard HTTP methods are used for CRUD operations (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Error Handling: Consistent error responses with appropriate status codes are implemented.
For a detailed overview of the API endpoints, refer to the Swagger Documentation.

## Database Design <a name="database-design"></a>

The database design is implemented using Prisma, ensuring a flexible and scalable schema definition. The design includes:

Entities: Core entities such as Users, Products, and Orders are defined with their respective fields and relationships.
Relationships: Proper relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) are established between entities to ensure data integrity.
